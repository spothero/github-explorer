# GitHub Explorer

A tiny Python project to gather metrics about our GitHub repos. It is currently "exploring" public repos, but we could use this project to gather metrics about our private repos as well.

The output of the Python script is summed up in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwTV880xn0nkqNUBwDN8q0bKOCdX0n8YPTALsSVFZ6I/edit?usp=sharing).
